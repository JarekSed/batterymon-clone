This directory contains the "source files" for the icon themes.

These files don't need to be installed and are not required by batterymon.
However, they are useful for modifying or creating new themes.

  "battery.svg" is original file, made in Inkscape. The colors were chosen
  from the Tango palette. It was later exported to PNG bitmap and then imported
  into Gimp.

  "battery.xcf" is the Gimp file, broken in several layers. For each final
  battery theme icon, a different set of layers was marked as visible and
  result was saves as PNG.

  These themes were previously posted at:
